However, Provence was stilled allowed to keep their own parliament of some sort, although that din't go well, for a major War of Religions broke out in Provence in the 16th century. The battle was between Catholics and Protestents, but it came to an end in 1593 with Protestants given their rights. &nbsp;</p>
	
		<p>&nbsp; However, that era of peace after the war ended in 1789 with the start of the French Revolution, causing major losses until Napoleon Bonaparte got the title of First Consul in 1799, and Emperor in 1804. The Industrial Revolution started, and Provence was peaceful and prosperous once again.  </p>
