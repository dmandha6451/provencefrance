  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;Provence is a country to which I am <strong>always</strong> returning, next week, any day now, as soon as I can get on a train&quot; - Elizabeth David (renowned British writer)</em></p></blockquote>
  
  <h1>P R O V E N C E, &nbsp; F R A N C E</h1>	
 <p>Provence, France has and will always be one of my favorite places to visit. Located a bit away from the major, and typical tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, Provence provides a calm and serene beauty, perfect for one to rest and enjoy themselves. From the gorgeous blue waters to bright lavender fields, Provence has scenery like no other, and the food never disappoints. </p>
  
  <h1>W H Y  &nbsp; P R O V E N C E?</h1>
	<h1></h1>
  <p>Provence is a land of beauty. If you are one interested or entranced by colorful landscapes, with lighting unlike any other, Provence is the land for you. Housing famous artists such as Vincent Van Gogh, Paul CÃ©zanne and Pablo Picasso, Provence has the beauty of art in every corner. The lavender fields located in Provence are a must see, as they are unlike any other in the world. The history showcased in Provence demonstrates the past of Provence and France, and the architecture is one of beauty.</p>
